# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

<img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheIsrael1/nft-task9-learnweb3dao/blob/master/imgp.GIF" />

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
